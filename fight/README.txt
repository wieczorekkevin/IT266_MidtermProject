FIGHT Mod

INFO

This mod is my attempt at bringing a 2D fighting game experience to Quake 4. 
It is extremely jank and wack, but was a lot of fun to work on nonetheless.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BASIC MECHANICS

Each fighter has the same normal attacks, a Punch, where you can hit opponents with a Low Punch when you're crouching, 
or a High Punch when standing. If the opponent is blocking while standing, High Punches will do no damage, so hit them 
with a Low Punch. The opposite is true, too! Make sure you're hitting the right spot!

Fighters also come with one Special move. This is unique to the character. 

Marineman's Special

Stroggman's Special doesn't do damage, but you can teleport in front of or behind enemies, depending on whether Crouch is held or not.

Corpseman's Special
